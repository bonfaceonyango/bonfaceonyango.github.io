We are a bioinformatics lab that researches ways to understand microbial ecosystems. In particular, we have interests in antimicrobial resistance, horizontal gene transfer, and microbiome research. Technique-wise we have expertise in amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, phylogenetics, and machine learning approaches.
