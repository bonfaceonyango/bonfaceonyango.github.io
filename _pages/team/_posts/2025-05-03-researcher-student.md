My scientific journey began in the labs of Cairo, where I studied everything from fish health to drug design, always asking how computation could solve biological puzzles. Today, as a bioinformatician at Dalhousie University, I’m tackling one of my most exciting challenges yet: decoding marine biodiversity through eDNA. Whether it’s designing and optimising analysis pipelines or collaborating on biodiversity monitoring research, I love turning data into actionable insights for conservation. Before joining the lab, I collaborated on projects from RNA degradation prediction (Kaggle gold medalist!) to new antiviral drug discovery. Science, to me, is a collaborative adventure, and I’m grateful to be part of a lab that values both innovation and community.
