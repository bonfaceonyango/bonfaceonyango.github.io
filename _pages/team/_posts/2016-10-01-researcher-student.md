I am interested in how methodological choices shape our interpretation of microbial communities, and in how we correct for them. By quantifying and correcting biases in high-throughput sequencing, I build reproducible pipelines that more accurately reflect biological patterns, and apply them for describing community responses to environmental disturbances in multi-year microbiome time series.
