My role is Atlantic Regional Coordinator for the Canadian Bioinformatics Hub. Through this position, I work closely with Dr. Rob Beiko and a pan-Canadian network of experts and knowledge users. Our mission is to accelerate the growth of a vibrant health and life sciences sector by scaling up Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Data Science capacity.

I have a Master of Science degree in Microbiology and Immunology, completing my bioinformatics training under Dr. Morgan Langille at Dalhousie University. Throughout my career, I have instructed others in genetics, molecular biology, and microbiome data science. I am passionate about continued education of trainees and professionals, and firmly believe that enhancing bioinformatics and computational biology competencies will support the success of Canada’s current and future scientists.
